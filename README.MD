# Huffman Encoding
## Thomas Reichman

Uses Huffman Nodes and Heap Nodes to build a Huffman tree. Can Traverse tree. Actual (de)compression not supported.

Testing:

D-Level:
Output a small chart consisting of each character and their corresponding frequency.

C-Level:
Output theHeap after making it.

B-Level: Made a new instance of traversal called trav and called it. Every step of the traversal (regarding the children, if any) has a line of output announcing the move made (the current node and path, specifically; as well as initialization)
